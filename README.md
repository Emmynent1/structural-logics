Description:

> Structural Logic is a mini-project that bridges the gap between civil engineering principles and computational logic.
It’s a space where I explore how structural ideas like load distribution, balance, and foundation strength can be modeled and expressed through code.

The repository currently contains:

README.md — Project overview, goals, and conceptual direction

foundation.py — A simple Python module for estimating a “foundation strength” based on material quality, design efficiency, and soil stability

reflection.md — Notes and reflections on how engineering thinking maps into programming logic


Future Work Plans:

1. Add modules to simulate load variations, safety factors, and stress-strain relations


2. Integrate visualization (e.g. matplotlib) to plot results


3. Document each iteration with comments, analysis notes, and explanations


4. Expand into more engineering cases (bridges, beams, columns) and show how logic carries across them
5.
