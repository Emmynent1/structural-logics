## Reflection

This project, *Structural Logic*, explores the intersection between engineering principles and logical systems.  
It reflects how civil engineering concepts—like load distribution and equilibrium—can be modeled through structured logic.  

Working on this helped me realize how closely computation mirrors real-world design, where both depend on clarity, structure, and balance.
